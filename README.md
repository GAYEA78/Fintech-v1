## Why does this project matter?

### 1. Traditional Banking Limitations
- Problem: Outdated interfaces and disconnected financial data.
- My Solution: Responsive UI with modern dashboard and real-time stock insights.

### 2. Security & Compliance Gaps
- Problem: Weak authentication and no identity verification.
- My Solution: Email-based 2FA,  document review, and admin role separation.

### 3. Lack of Financial Intelligence
- Problem: No personalized investment options or risk analysis.
- My Solution: Investor profiling, auto-matched portfolios, and drift alerts.

### 4. Transaction Inaccuracies
- Problem: Poor balance tracking and missing audit trails.
- My Solution: Double-entry ledger system with full transaction history.

### 5. Disconnected Customer Support
- Problem: No internal messaging or conversation tracking.
- My Solution: Built-in chat between users and admins with history tracking.

### 6. Payment Integration Challenges
- Problem: Insecure or manual payment handling.
- My Solution: Stripe Checkout with proper redirection and confirmation views.

### 7. Missing Financial Education Tools
- Problem: Users can't learn investing through the app.
- My Solution: Simulated trading, asset visualization, and portfolio tracking.

### 8. Operational Inefficiencies for Admins
- Problem: No centralized admin control.
- My Solution: Admin dashboard with account control, user messaging, and  tools.
